- Causality and Experiments

An observational study is one in which scientists make conclusions based on data that they have observed but had no hand in generating. 
In data science, many such studies involve observations on a group of individuals, a factor of interest called a treatment, 
and an outcome measured on each individual.

The fundamental question is whether the treatment has an effect on the outcome. Any relation between the treatment and the outcome 
is called an association. 
If the treatment causes the outcome to occur, then the association is causal. 
Causality is at the heart of all three questions posed at the start of this section. 
For example, one of the questions was whether chocolate directly causes improvements in health, not just whether there 
is a relation between chocolate and health.
The establishment of causality often takes place in two stages. 
First, an association is observed. 
Next, a more careful analysis leads to a decision about causality.
